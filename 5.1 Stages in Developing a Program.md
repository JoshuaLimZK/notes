**5 stages in developing a program**
Gather requirements ▶ Plan solutions ▶ Write code ▶ Test and refine code ▶ Deploy code

# 5.1.1 Gather Requirements
- Goal: Determine the nature of the problem, why a program is needed and what the program is expected to do
- If not done performed properly, the program developed may not actually solve the problem.
- Examples of Tasks:
	- Interviewing the intended audience of the program to understand the nature of the problem of their expectations
	- Specifying the complete set of inputs that is necessary for the problem and how the inputs can be supplied ot the program
	- Specifying the complete set of outputs that is necessary for the problem and the format for the output
# 5.1.2 Plan Solutions
- After gathering and refining the required inputs and outputs of the program, plan out a solution using the skills of **decomposition**, **pattern recognition** and **generalisation**. 
- Goal:
	- Consider the options available before any code is written
	- Choose an algorithm based on the resources available (e.g. manpower, time)
- Examples of Tasks:
	- Manually solving different simplified examples of the problem and generalising the steps needed to produce the required output
	- Trying different ways to break down the problem into smaller parts such that the intended output of each part gets closer and closer to what is needed to solve the problem
	- Comparing the problem (or its smaller parts) to other problems that have been solved before and identifying which algorithms can be reused
	- Estimating the amount of effort needed to write the code or the time needed to complete the algorithm before making a definite choice
	- Writing possible algorithms using either flowcharts of pseudo-code
# 5.1.3 Write Code
- In traditional program development, the code for the final program is not actually written until the first two stages of have been completed
- This minimises the possibility of producing code based on incomplete requirements or inefficient algorithms that would eventually need to be discarded.
- Goal: write code that performs the algorithm as planned in the previous stage as efficiently as possible

# 5.1.4 Test and Refine Code
After the initial code is written, the resulting program is likely to require further refinement. Some possible reasons for this:
- The programmer may have made mistakes in translating the planned algorithm into code or may have forgotten to consider exceptional cases where the input would need to be treated specially.
  E.g. the programmer made a syntax error or forgot to check for invalid input
  These are relatively minor errors that would not require the major rewriting of code
  
- The solution-planning stage may not have been performed properly, resulting in an unsuitable or incomplete algorithm
  Code might need to be refined or rewritten based on the seriousness of the mismatch
  
- The requirement-gathering stage may have been incomplete, resulting in code that does not actually solve the problem. It may or may not be possible to reuse written code depending on how serious the mismatch is.

**Key Terms:**
***Test case:*** A set of inputs and the corresponding set of expected outputs for a particular program used to verify whether the program works as intended
***Testing:*** Process which defects in a program can be detected

# 5.1.5 Deploy Code
Examples of Tasks:
- Training users to use the program
- Transitioning from an old program or system to the new program
- Evaluating the effectiveness of the program in solving the problem and considering any changes that might increase its usability or effectiveness
