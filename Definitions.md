# Chapter 2
**Algorithm:** Set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem

**Input (algorithm):** Data used by an algorithm that can affect what is required for correct output
**Output (algorithm):** Results produced by an algorithm
**Solution:** Algorithm that always gives the correct outputs when provided with valid inputs

**Decomposition:** Breaking down a complex problem or process into smaller and more manageable parts
**Sub-problem** A problem whose solution contributes to the solution of a bigger problem
**Pattern recognition:** Identifying similarities among two or more items
**Generalisation:** Technique of replacing two or more similar problems or solutions with a single, more general problem or solution

# Chapter 3
**Variable (flowchart and pseudo-code):** Named storage space for a value that can be changed while the algorithm is running
**Initialise:** To store or assign a value to a variable for the first time

**Flow Chart:** Visual presentation of an algorithm using symbols to show the flow of a sequence of steps
**Flow line:** Arrow that indicates the order in which steps should be followed
**Symbol (flowchart):** Special shape used to represent an action or step in a flowchart
**Construct:** Algorithm structure with exactly one entry point and one exit point
