# 2.3.1 Decomposition
**Definition:**
*Decomposition* is the technique of breaking down a complex problem into small parts known as *sub-problems* such that each part is more manageable and easier to understand. The parts are evaluated separately and the solutions to these parts are the combined to solve the original problem

**Common Approaches to decomposing a problem**
1. *Incremental Approach*
	Identify quantitative features of the input or output that are causing the problem to be too large to handle. 
	Sometimes, the solution to a small version of the problem with one or more of these features reduced can be found and gradually extended to large versions of the problem.
	Each gradual extension of the solution is a separate sub-problem.
2. *Modular Approach*
	Solve simple examples of the problem manually and identify task that are of different natures. 
	Tasks can be separated from each other to become distinct (and sometimes unrelated) sub-problems.
	Usually results in sub-problems that are different from each other.

# 2.3.2 Pattern Recognition
**Definition:**
*Pattern recognition* is the technique of identifying similarities among two or more items. In problem-solving and algorithm design, it is usually used in three ways:

1. Identifying patterns among two or more problems
   ↪ We can **use one solution** to **solve** other **problems that follow a similar pattern**
2. Identifying patterns among two or more problems
   ↪ These patterns show that **solutions** can be used to **generalise to produce a single solution** to **solve multiple problems**
3. Identifying patterns among two or more steps in a solution
   ↪ These patterns indicate that the solution can be simplified using iteration structures `#link to next chapter`.
# 2.3.3 Generalisation
**Definition**
*Generalisation* is the technique of replacing multiple similar items with a single more general item. *This can be done with both problems and solutions*

A general solution is extremely useful because it allows us to solve a large number of problems with just a single solution.
