**Key Terms:**
***Programming Language:*** Language designed for humans to communicate instructions to computers
***Source code:*** Instructions written in a programming language that both humans and computers can understand

Machine code is hard for humans to read and write. Programs written with a **programming languages** such as Python are translated to machine code for computers and humans to understand.

**Key Terms:**
***Syntax:*** Rules that determine how the words and symbols in a valid instruction are arranged
***Syntax error:*** Result of incorrect source code that does not follow the rules of the language

In order for source code to be translated to machine code, source code must follow rules that dictate how words and symbols in each instruction must be arranged. These rules are called **syntax**
**Syntax errors** occur when these rules are not follower. This type of mistake is detected by the translator program. The incorrect source code cannot be translated to machine code.
