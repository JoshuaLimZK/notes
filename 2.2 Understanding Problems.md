[[2 How Can Algorithms Be Used to Solve Problems|< Return]]
# 2.2.1 Problems
**To understand a problem, we need to specify its:** ^adc44e
1. Inputs and Valid Input Requirements (i.e. Input Validation)
2. Outputs and Correct Output Requirements
**Output** $\rightarrow$ Result that the algorithm Produces
**Input** $\rightarrow$ Data used by an algorithm that can affect what is required for correct output

**Process flow in problem-solving:**
**INPUT** $\rightarrow$ **PROCESSES** $\rightarrow$ **OUTPUT**

# 2.2.2 Specifying the Inputs
**Good Input Specification:**
1. Include only important data that can affect what is required for the output and exclude irrelevant details.
2. State the range of valid or acceptable values for these inputs.
*It is also a good practice to give each input a name*

# 2.2.3 Specifying the Outputs
**Good Output Specification**:
1. Include all the important features that the output is required to have
2. Any details no mentioned are unimportant or irrelevant
