# What is a Cold War?
- <u>An ideological struggle</u> between democracy and communism
- The two leading blocks (<u>bipolar</u>) - the US and the USSR
- <u>Indirect fighting</u>
- Competing with one another to build up arms (<u>arms race</u>)
- <u>Internal dissent suppressed</u>
How was it fought?
- Regular arguments during <u>UN</u> assembly
- Criticised and accused one another in the <u>media</u> using propaganda
- <u>Threats</u> of military war
- <u>Proxy Wars</u> - sent troops/advisers to other states/groups to disrupt the aims and plans of their opponents
# Why was there a Cold War?
## Conflicting Political Systems/Ideology
|USA|USSR|
|---|---|
|• Belief in **self-determination** (freedom)|• Belief in a **utopian society** after world wide revolution (equality for all)|
|• Political system: By the people, of the people, for the people|• Political system: communist Party centralises all power; One party state|
|• Economic system: **Free Market**|• Economic system: **Command Economy**|

### Why were the 2 systems unable to co-exist?
- Marx's theory that all Capitalist class will one day be over-pushed by Working class (CLASS STRUGGLE)
- Capitalist fear of the Domino Theory — must prevent at all cost
- Led to deep mistrust/conflicts between both systems
- E.g. Post-WWII Communist parties in Russia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Greece, etc.

## Wartime alliances broken down
- The alliance between USSR, USA and Britain lasted from 1941–45
- It was clearly a temporary relationship of convenience/mutual benefits
- Several disagreement broke out during negotiations from a post-war settlement
**(i) The Yalta Conference (Feb '45)**
Important Terms:
1. Stalin enters war against Japan once Germany surrenders
2. Germany to be divided into 4 zones: US, France, Britain, USSR. Berlin to be divided into 4 too
3. Hunt down and punish Nazi war criminals
4. Countries occupied by Germany would hold free elections for governments
5. Big 3 Joined UNO, which aimed to keep peace after WWII
6. Eastern Europe = Soviet Sphere of Influence
Positive Effects:
- Allies learnt Lessons of Versailles
- International cooperation through United Nations Organisation
Problems:
- US and Britain worried about Eastern Europe falling to communism

**(ii) The Potsdam Conference (Jul-Aug '45)**
- 30 April 1945: Hitler committed suicide
- European front won
- 2nd conference held in Potsdam (Berlin)
- Now that Germany was defeated, no more common enemy
- Major Changes that affected their relationship
- Aug '45
	- Britain: Churchill lost in an election to Clement Attlee halfway through Potsdam Conference
	- Attlee was a conservative focused on rebuilding Britain
- Problematic Changes:
	1. Stalin's armies were occupying most of Eastern Europe
		- Soviet troops did not withdraw after freeing the countries:
		  Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania
	2. America had a new president
		- 12 Apr 1945, Roosevelt died. Replaced by Harry Truman
		- Roosevelt was willing to recognise Soviet sphere of influence while Truman was unwilling
		- Anti communist, suspicious of Stalin
		- Felt Stalin was trying to take over Europe
		- Critisied Soviet Policy in Poland and cut off the lend-lease aid programme. 
	2. Allies had tested an atomic bomb
		- 16 July 1945, Truman informed stalin about tests, no longer needed Sovet help in Japan
		- Stalin felt througened and was more determined to challenge US
		- USSR successfully detonated its 1st atomic bomb in august 1949, sparking an arms race
## Power vacuum in Europe
*to edit*

# US Reaction to USSR's control over Eastern Europe
- 9 Feb — Stalin's speech on inherent conflict between communism and capitalism
- George Kennan (US Deputy head of American Embassy in USSR) send the '<u>Long Telegram</u>' to 22 February, which became basis for the US **policy of containment**

## Main Points of Long Telegram
- USSR justified its eastablishment of Eastern Europe as sphere of influence due to <u>hostile historical experiences of being invaded from the east</u>
- Aggressive expansion by USSR to <u>spread its influence and dominance</u>
- <u>Isolation no longer an option</u>; USA must be involved and adopt global strategy to deal with Soviets
- <u>War not necessary</u> - 'long term, patient but firm and vigilant containment' required

## Adopting the containment policy
- Lessons of WWI - <u>isolation by USA led to European instability</u>
- Did not want to repeat the mistakes post-WWI
- <u>Every Communist action will lead to an American reaction</u> - ensure that USSR did not spread beyong the borders whre it was already established
- Containment policy marked clear shift away from isolationism

## Effects of the Iron Curtain Speech
- Verbalised the ideological and political split
- Symbolic expression of how USSR attempted to prevent its allies from antact with the West
- Strengthened Western views that USSR was hostile and <u>stronger actions were needed</u> from the USA, hence containment

## Truman Doctrine 1947
**Origins:**
- Britain crippled by economic crisis
- Civil War in Greece - trouble stirred up by communists
- Possibility of similar uprising in Italy and Turkey
- Money required to strengthen non-communist governments
**Speech on 12 May 1947:**
- Openly criticised and challenged Communism
- Urged the US to provide financial/military aid to any nations threatened by 'armed minorities or by outside pressure'
- Eg: Greece, Turkey
- Domino Theory and Containment.

## The Marshall Plan (1948-1952)
The US provided economic aid for the reconstruction of war-torn Europe.
Reasons:
1. Believed that economic recovery would stop spread of communism — Communist government took over in Czechoslovakia under suspicious circumstances
2. A prosperous Europe would be a major market for the US
Paris Conference:
- 16 Western European states accepted the aid
	- USD 13 Billion over 4 years
	- Technical Assistance — e.g. chemical, engineering & steel industries
Soviet Response:
- Not Acceptable
- Boycotted the Paris Conference
- Accepting aid ▶ Weakening control over Eastern Europe
- Form of US domination: Dependence on the US for money ▶ new form of imperialism
Impacts:
- Helped Western Europe to recover politically and economically
- Western Europe <u>indebted to USA</u>
- Made capitalism <u>more attractive to Eastern Europe countries</u>
- *Undermined Soviet authority in Eastern Europe*

# Soviet counter to Containment
- Tightened control over Eastern Europe
- Established <u>Cominform</u> (Communist Information Bureau) in September 1947
- Coordinated all Communist Parties' <u>policies and tactics</u>; <u>minimise trade and contact</u> with non-communist countries
- Close supervision of all leaders
- Jan 1949 — set up Comecon (Council of Mutual Economic Assistance) to coordinate Cominform's economic policies
- However, could not match the Marshall Plan in terms of Economic Aid

# Post WWII Germany
- German Recovery
	-  German economy crippled and in chaos
	- Could not feed Germans unless industries rebuilt
	- US, Br, Fra combined their zones in 1946 and controlled trade, foreign relations, economy
	- New laws and currency introduced in 1948
	- Antagonised Stalin
## The Berlin Blockade (June 1948–May 1949)
- Stalin was angered by the actions of the Western powers to reunify Germany
- He decided to blockade the three western zones of Berlin
- All vital roads, railways and canals blocked; electricity as well
- 2 million people cut off
- Reasons
	- Official reason - "Prevent devalued Reichsmarks from entering Soviet Zone"
	- Actual Reasion - Force the Allies out of Berlin
	- Make Berlin dependent on USSR by starving the people
**American Response**
Truman flew in supplies to people for 11 months
To show how 

- Stalin lifted blockade on 12 May 1949

## How did the blockade backfire on Stalin?
- Having set up the blockade on the basis of preventing devalued currency from causing economic chaos, Stalin could not afford to shoot down the Allied supply planes
- It would lead to international backlash
