Data in a computer is stored as a sequence of bytes. Sequences can be interpreted as different types of data. Python manages the arrangement and interpretation of the bytes in each variable. This is done by associating each value and variable with a data type.

| Data type      | Python  | Valid vlues              | Example   |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| Integer        | `int`   | Whole Numbers            | 1234      |
| Floating Point | `float` | Real Numbers             | 12.34     |
| String         | `str`   | Text(can include digits) | "ABC123"  |
| Boolean        | `bool`  | True, False              | True      |
| List           | `list`  | Multiple Values          | [1, 2, 3] |               |         |                          |           |

**Key Terms:**
***Floating-point number (`float`):*** Data type to represent real numbers that contain fractional part
***Integer (`int`):*** Data type representing whole numbers (positive and negative)
***Literal:*** Format for representing a value directly in source code
***String(`str`):*** Data type to represent text as a sequence of characters or symbols
***Escape code:*** Sequence of characters used to input characters that are either difficult to type out as part of a literal or would cause a syntax error if not treated specifically
***Type casting:*** Process of converting a value from one data type to another
***Boolean(`bool`):*** Data type representing either `True` or `False`
***Array:*** Sequence where all the items have the same size and are arranged consecutively in memory; informally also used as a synonym for list
***List (programming):*** Data type for storing multiple values in a sequence
