**Key Terms:**
***Argument:*** Additional value that can be supplied as input to a function call
***Function:*** Set of instructions assigned to a name that can be used again later
***Function call:*** Process of assigning arguments to new variables and running the instructions assigned to a function
***Nested function call:*** Using the return of one functional call as an argument for another function call
***Return value:*** Output of a function, or the value that a function call is treated as, after the instruction assigned to the function are completed
***Body (functions):*** Sequence of statements in a User-defined function
***Indentation:*** Number of spaces at the start of each line of source code
***User-defined function:*** Function provided by the user of a programming language
***Parameter:*** Special variable in a UDF that an argument is assigned to when the UDF is called
***Signature (programming):*** First line of a UDF that specifies the UDF's name and its parameters
***Return instruction:*** Instruction that ends the function immediately and treates the original function call the the provided return value.
***Local variable:*** Variable that is created inside a UDF and can only be used in the UDF's body
***Global variable:*** Variable that is created outside a UDF and is readable from the UDF's body if its name is not hidden by a local variable
***Binary operator:*** Operator that takes in exactly two values
***Operator:*** Symbol for performing instructions like function but using a different syntax
***Floor Division:*** Division operation that rounds down to the nearest integer
***Sequence:*** Any data type for storing multiple values in order, usually a `list` or `str` or range
***Concatenation:*** Joining two sequences to make a longer sequence
***Index:*** An `int` value for the position of a value in a sequence
***Index operator:*** Operator for returning a value in a sequence
***Slice operator:*** Operator for returning a sequence (not a value) by extracting values from a sequence
***Immutable:*** Cannot be changed once created
