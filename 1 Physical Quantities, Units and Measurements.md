# Physical Quantities
Physical attributes that can be measured are known as ***physical quantities***
A physical quantity always consists of a numerical ***magnitude*** and ***unit***

# SI Units and Base Units
The International System of Units (Systéme international d'unités) is the most widely used system of units
It comprises a system of units of measurements built of seven base units:

| Physical Quantity   | Common Units                        | SI Unit  | Symbol |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Length              | metre, mile, inch                   | metre    | $m$    |
| Mass                | gram, pound, ounch                  | kilogram | $kg$   |
| Time                | second, minute, hour                | second   | $s$    |
| Electric Current    | ampere                              | ampere   | $A$    |
| Temperature         | degrees celsius, fahrenheit, kelvin | kelvin   | $K$    |
| Amount of Substance | mole                                | mole     | $mol$  |
| Luminous Intensity  | candela, lumen, lux                 | candela  | $cd$   | 

# Prefixes and Order of Magnitude

| Prefix | Order of Magnitude | Symbol   |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------- |
| nano   | $10^{-9}$          | $n$      |
| micro  | $10^{-6}$          | $\micro$ |
| milli  | $10^{-3}$          | $m$      |
| centi  | $10&{-2}$          | $c$      |
| deci   | $10^{-1}$          | $d$      |
| kilo   | $10^{3}$           | $k$      |
| mega   | $10^{6}$           | $M$      |
| giga   | $10^{9}$           | $G$      | 

# Accuracy & Precision
**Accuracy**
Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a standard or known value.
**Precision**
Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurement to each other.

# Types of errors
**Random errors**
- Occurs in all measurements
- It occurs when an observer estimates the last figure of a reading on an instrument.
- Possible causes:
	- Human reaction time
	- Background noise
	- Mechanical vibrations
- Cannot be predicted
- It can be reduced by taking large number of readings and average them.
**Systematic errors**
- Not random but constant
- It may cause an observer to consistently underestimate or overestimate a reading.
- Possible cause:
	- Zero error of an instrument: any indication that a measuring system gives a false reading when the true value of a measured quantity is zero
	- It can be eliminated if we know the sources of the errors.
