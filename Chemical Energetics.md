- Exothermic reactions ▶ Energy is released by the system into its surroundings
- Endothermic reactions ▶ Energy is absorbed by the system from its surroundings

- Enthalpy change ($\Delta H$), unit kilojoules (kJ), is the net change in energy between the reactants and the products
- Negative $\Delta H$ = Exothermic Reaction
- Positive $\Delta H$ = Endothermic Reaction

- Atoms must break their chemical bondings with other atoms before products are formed.
- ↪ Requires energy and hence energy is absorbed from the surroundings
- $\therefore$ Bond breaking is endothermic

- Atoms have to form new chemical bonds before products are formed
- ↪ Energy is released into the surroundings
- $\therefore$ Bond making is exothermic
# Exothermic Reactions
Reactions where the energy released during bond-making is greated then the energy absorbed for bond-breaking.

During an exothermic reaction, heat is liberated and the temperature of the mixture rises

Examples:
- Changes in state
- Combustion
	- Occurs in the presence of Oxygen and generates heat as one of its products
- Neutralisation
