# Factors leading to the outbreak of WWII in Eurpope
## Weakness of the League of Nations
- Achieved some successes in resolving conflicts in 1920s.
- Authority and Credibility affected by:
	- Weakness in its structure and organisation
	- Association with the Treaty of Versailles
	- Lack of commitment among the major powers

### Failure of Disarmament
- Seen as the most effective step in preventing another world war and to establish world peace
- League did not manage to achieve much success in this area
- Successes were the result of individual major European powers
- Meant that powerful countries still had militarty capacity for war
- There was nothing to stop them from engaging in conflicts

**Attempts at disarmament in the 1920s and 1930s**
- ***1921*** - Washington Naval Conference **(Success)**
	- Negotiated outside the league
	- Organised by USA, not a league member
	- Set ratio for tonnage of capital ships
		- Britain, USA - 5
		- Japan - 3
		- France - 1.67
		- Italy - 1.67
- ***1925*** - Locarno Treaties **(Partial Success)**
	- Negotiated outside the League between BR, GER, FR, IT, BEL, POL, CZH
	- Guaranteed Belgian and French Borders with Germany
	- Weimar Govt. accepted the demilitarisation of the Rhineland
	- Weimar Govt. agreed to settle any disputed with the about countries through the league
- ***1926*** - League Commission to prepare for World Disarmament Conference **(Failure)**
	- Britain and France refused to cooperate
- ***1928*** - Kellogg-Briand Pact **(Failure)**
	- Initiated by American Secretary of State *Frank Kellogg* and French Foreign Minister *Aristide Briand*
	- Negotiated outside the League between 15 countries including USA, FR, GER, BR, IT, JAP
	- Agreement that all conflicts should only be resolved by pacifist means
	- No clear way to enforce the pact
- ***1932-34*** World Disarmament Conference **(Failure)**
	- Held at Geneva, Switzerland
	- Germany insisted on matching the other powers' armament level
	- France refused to limit its armaments
	- Britain and US refused t commit at a level requested by France
	- Hitler withdrew Germany from the conference and the League

- Showed the importance of the involvement of the USA
- USA commanded much more respect that the League who was made up of weakened European nations
- Only Britain and France were the only ones capable with enforcing the League's will
- However they saw their own national interests above those of the League due to: Being severely weakened by WWI and the Great Depression of 1929
- The inability for the powers to trust one another and work towards disarmaments led to the a general atmosphere of distrust which would eventually lead to WWII

### 1935 Abyssinian Crisis
- Served as a prime example of its ineffectiveness in maintaining world peace and resolving conflicts
- Convinced Hitler that the League would not be able to stand in its way of this ambitious plans for expansion

**Implications of the Abyssinian Crisis**

- The league suffered many blows to its credibility **by 1935**, especially from its failure to intervene in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria
- Unlike Manchuria, Abyssinia had common borders with British colonies, and was also much closer to Europe.
- More reason for the League and major powers like BR and FR, to intervene when Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935.
- Britain, France and Italy were allies at the time under the Stresa Front ▶ They did not want to make an enemy of Italy and Mussolini
- Fear that embargo on oil would drive Mussolini into an alliance with Hitler, the League imposed limited economic sanctions on Italy
- The League's failure to imposed meaningful sanctions lead to its demise and the Italian takeover of Abyssinia in **May 1936**. 
- Failure of the major powers and the League to stop the invasion of Abyssinia made Mussolini and Hitler even bolder in their ambitions
- Britain and France's decision to avoid offending Mussolini proved to be a mistake ▶ Mussolini established the Rome-Berlin Axis with Hitler **later the same year (October 1936)**

**Timeline:**
- ***Dec 1934*** - dispute at Wal-Wal Oasis in Abysssinian territory between Abyssinian and Italian soldiers - Abyssinian Emperor Haile Selassie appealed to the League for help
	↪ **Mussolini wated to:**
	- Make Italy a great power
	- Exact revenge for Italy's defeat to Abyssinia in 1896
	- Exploit Abyssinia's mineral wealth
- ***Jan - Oct 1935:*** - Mussolini prepared his aremy to invade Abyssinia using the dispute at Wal-Wal Oasis as a pretext
	↪ **4 Sep 1935**
	- LoN absolved both Abyssinia and Italy of all guilt in the dispute
	- The League, along with BR and FR did not discourage Italy's military buildup
- ***3 Oct 1935*** - Italy invaded Abyssinia - a clear breach of the League Covenant
	↪ **Measures taken by the League**
	- Imposed ban on arms sales, loans and exports of rubber tin and metals to Italy, while allowing arms to be sold to Abyssinia
	- Delayed ban on sale of oil to Italy (did not want to harm economic interests of important league members)
	↪ **Measures taken by Britain and France**
	- Britain and France, who owned the Suez Canal, did not close it to Italian ships - Italy could ship war supplies to Abyssinia unhindered
	- Foreign ministers Hoare and Laval proposed a secret plan to give Mussolini two-thirds of Abyssinia in return for stoping the invasion
	- France was convinced of the need for Italy's support against Hitler, who remilitarised the Rhineland at this time
- ***9 May 1936*** - Italy conquered Abyssinia
- ***Nov 1936*** - Mussolini & Hitler signed a treaty of Friendship, establishing the Rome-Berlin Axis

## Hitler's expansionist Policy
- Played a major role in contributing towards the outbreak of WWII in Europe
