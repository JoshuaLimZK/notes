# 11.1 Computer Network
**Definition**
A computer network is a system of two or more computers that are connected together by a **transmission medium** for the exchange of data.

| Advantages             | Disadvantages     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Shared Resources       | Initial Costs     |
| Shared Internet Access | Maintenance Costs |
| Shared Software        | Security Risks    |
| Shared Storage         | Risk of data loss |
| Communication          | Server Outage     | 

# 11.2 Types of Computer Networks
Can be classified according to: Geographical Size, Transmission medium and network organisation type.

## 11.2.1 Geographical Size
Depending on the geographical coverage of the network, a network can be classified into:
1. Local Area Network (LAN)
2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
3. Wide Area Network (WAN)

### 11.2.1.1 Local Area Network
**Definition**
A network of computing devices connected within a small geographical area, typically within the same building.
- Due to the small number of connections supported and the close proximity of the devices, LANs typically provide faster data transfers that other networks
### 11.2.1.2 Metropolitan Area Network
**Definition**
A network of computing devices covering a large geographical area - two or more buildings within the same town or city - than a LAN. A MAN is typically owned and operated by a large organisation such as a business or government body.
### 11.2.1.3 Wide Area Network
**Definition**
A network of computing devices covering a large-scale geographical area, typically across multiple geographical locations.
- Consists of multiple smaller networks
- WAN is not limited to a single geographical location and can span long distances via long-range transmission media such as telephone lines, fibre optic cables or satellite links.
- Can either be public or private. The internet is an example of a public WAN. Private WANs are built and maintained by large multinational companies and government organisations.

## 11.2.2 Transmission Medium
### 11.2.2.1 Wired Networks
**Definition**
A network of devices connected by a physical medium, such as cables.
Data transfer is typically faster and more secure in a wired network.
