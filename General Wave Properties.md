# General Wave Properties

## 1.1 What are Waves
1. Travelling **disturbance** that **transfers** energy from one place to another
2. Made up of **periodic** motion (a motion that repeats itself at **regular** intervals)
3. The source of any wave is an **oscillation** or **vibration**

## 1.3 Types of wave motion
1. **Transverse** waves travel **perpendicular** to the direction of the oscillation or vibration
2. **Longitudinal** waves are waves that travel **parallel** to the direction of the oscillation or vibration
3. Examples:

| Transverse            | Logitudinal        |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Rope Waves            | Sound Waves        |
| Water Waves           | Earthquake P waves |
| Electromagnetic waves |                    |
| Earthquake S waves    |                    |
| Rayleigh waves        |                    |
| Love waves            |                    |

## 2.1 Wave terms
Crests - **Highest** points on a **transverse** wave
- A particle at the crest is momentarily at rest
Troughs - **Lowest** points on a **transverse** wave
- A particle at the trough is momentarily at rest
Amplitude, A - **maximum** displacement of a point (or wave particle) from its **rest** position
Wavelength $\lambda$ - **shortest** distance between any 2 points (or wave particles) that are **in phase**
Phase - Points along a wave are **in phase** if they have the **same**:
- **displacement** from their rest positions
- **direction of travel**
- **speed**
Period, T - **time** taken to produce one **complete** wave
- SI unit: seconds(s)
Frequency, f - The number of **complete** waves produced **per unit time**
- It is also the number of crests or troughs that move past a certain point waves per unit time.
- Frequency = reciprocal of the period, $f = \frac{1}{T}$ 
- SI unit: Hertz, 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second

## 2.2 Displacement-distance graph
- Captures the wave motion with the displacements of all the wave particles at one particular **instant in time**
- One cycle along the horizontal (distance) axis represents the **wavelength, $\lambda$**
- The **amplitude can also be obtained from the graph**

## 2.3 Displacement-time graph
- Describes the displacement of **one wave particle**, tracking it change over time,  unlike displacement-distance graph
- One cycle along the horizontal (time) axis represents the **period, T = 1/f**
- The **amplitude** can also be obtained from the graph

## 2.4 Speed of a wave
- In the time of 1 period, T, the crest moved a distance of 1 wavelength, $\lambda$
- Thus wave speed is given by:
	$V = \frac{\lambda}{T}$
	$V = (\frac{1}{T})\times\lambda$
	since $f = \frac{1}{t}$, 
	$V = f\lambda$
	where:
	$V$ = wave speed (in m/s)
	$f$ = frequency (in Hz)
	$\lambda$ = wavelength (in m)

## 3.2 Wavefront
- **Imaginary** line on a wave that joins all points on a wave that are in the same **phase** of vibration
- The wave front is perpendicular to the direction of wave motion

## 3.3 Reflection of Waves
- Waves follow the law of reflection
- The angle of incidence, $i$, is **equal to** the angle of reflection, $r$

## 3.4 Refraction of waves
As the water wave crosses the interface from the deep region to the shallow region:
1. The speed, $V$, **decreases**. Water waves travel at a **higher speed** in **deep water** than shallow water
2. the frequency, $f$, remains unchanged since the wave is produced at its source
3. the wavelength, $\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$, **decreases.** The wavefronts are more closely spaced
4. The wave bends **towards the normal**. The angle of refraction, $r$, is **smaller** than the angle of incidence, $i$.
5. The wavefronts are **connected** at the interface (boundary)
