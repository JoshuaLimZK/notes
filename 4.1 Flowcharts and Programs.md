**Key Terms:**
***Instruction set:*** Set of basic commands or instructions that a processor can understand in byte form
***Machine code:*** Instructions that can run directly on a computer's processor
***Program:*** Set of instructions written to perform specific tasks on a computer

Computers do not have the same common sense and knowledge of natural languages that humans have. Instructions must be decomposed and rewritten into steps that the computer can understand.
However, since computers understand only bytes, the data and steps need to be represented as bytes as well.
This is done using the processor's **instruction set** which specifies how the instructions how the processor understands instructions represented as bytes.
