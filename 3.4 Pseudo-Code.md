**Key Terms:**
***Pseudo-code:*** Description of an algorithm using natural language (such as English) mixed with sequences, selection and iteration constructs

# 3.4.1 Input/Output
the `INPUT` command is used to receive data from outside the algorithm
the `OUTPUT` command is used to produce a result from within the algorithm
**SYNTAX:**
```
INPUT <variable name>
OUTPUT <output value>
```
# 3.4.2 Sequence Constructs
Consecutive lines of pseudo-code forms a **sequence construct**
# 3.4.3 Selection Constructs
**Selection constructs** are used when a choice between multiple decisions has to be made based on a condition or the answer to a question.
The `IF...THEN...ELSEIF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF` commands are used to determine which steps are followed based on a decision
**SYNTAX:**
```
IF <condition> THEN
	<...>
ELSEIF <condition> THEN
	<...>
ELSE
	<...>
ENDIF
```
# 3.4.4 Iteration Constructs
**Iteration Constructs** are used to repeat instructions
1. `WHILE...ENDWHILE`
2. `FOR...NEXT`
## 3.4.4.1 `WHILE...ENDWHILE`
**SYNTAX:**
```
WHILE <condition> THEN
	<...>
ENDWHILE
```
## 3.4.4.2 `FOR...NEXT`
**SYNTAX:**
```
FOR <variable> = <lowerint> to <upperint>
	<...>
NEXT x
```
***NOTE:** iterations are inclusive of `<lowerint>` and `<upperint>`*
