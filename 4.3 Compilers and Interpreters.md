**Key Terms:**
***Compiler:*** Code translator program that translates source code into machine code completely before running the compiled program
***Interpreter:*** Code translator program that translates source code to machine code while the interpreted program in running

There are 2 ways that source code is translated:
1. **Complier**
	Reads the source code, performs that translation once, and the stores the translated machine code on the computer. When the program is run, the machine code that was compiled previously is reused and the compiler is no longer needed for the program to function
	Example: C, Pascal
2. **Interpreter**
	Run every time the program starts. Reads the source code while the program is running and performs on-the spot translation or determines which part of its own machine code to run. Generally, translated machine code is discarded after program is stopped and the interpreter is needed every time the program is run.
	Example: Python, Scratch

| D/A        | Compilers                                                                                        | Interpreters |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Advantages | • Resulting program runs at a faster speed because all the translation had been done beforehand. <br> • The compiler is not needed to run the program after compilation is complete. <br> • Syntax errors are detected before the program is even run.|• Changes to the source code take effect immediately. <br> • Interpreters usually offer an interactive mode, which facilitates learning and experimentation.|
|Disadvantages|• Any changes to the source code requires recompilation to before taking effect. <br> • Compilers usually do not offer an interactive mode.|• The resulting program runs at a slower speed because translation occurs while the program is running. <br> • The interpreter needs to be run every time the program is started <br> • Syntax errors may interrupt the running of a program|

# 4.3.1 Using the Python Interpreter
**Key Terms:**
***Command line interface:*** Means with interacting with a program such that commands are given as lines of text
***Graphical user interface:*** Means of interacting with a program such that commands are given using visual elements such as windows, icons, menus and mouse pointers.
***Syntax highlighting:*** Displaying different parts of source code differently (such as using different colours and fonts) in a text editor baed on the syntax of the programming language to make reading easier.
***Interactive mode:*** Feature of Python that allows source code to be entered line by line for the interpreter to run immediately and show the results
