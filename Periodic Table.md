# Groups
- Vertical columns
- Same as the number of valence electrons of the elements.
- Elements in the same group will have similar properties

# Periods
- Horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table.
- Left to right â–¶ metallic properties of element decrease
- Indicated number of electron shells an element has
- Elements in the same period = same number of electron shells

# Group 1 Metals
 - Alkali metals
	 â†ª React with water to form alkalies
- Properties:
	- Shiny
	- Silvery
	- Soft
	- Lower in Density
- Low boiling and melting points
	- Decreases down the groups as there are more electron shells
	- Atomic Radius increase
	- Less energy required to remove valence electrons
	- Less energy required overcome strong electrostatic forces of attraction between cations and anions
- Electrical and Thermal Conductivity
	- Good conductors of electricity and heat
	- Arranged in a giant metallic lattice with strong electrostatic forces of attraction between its "sea" of delocalised electrons and cations
	- The "sea" of delocalised electrons act as mobile charge carriers that conduct electricity and heat
- Reactivity
	- Very reactive
	- Stored under oil to present the metal from air and moisture
	- Reactivity increases down the group as the atomic radius increases.
	- Lesser energy is required to overcome the strong electrostatic forces of attractions between the cations and valence electrons
# Group 7 Elements
- Halogens
- Non-metal, diatomic molecules
- Properties:
	- Low melting and boiling point
	- Colour gets darker down the group
- Boiling and melting points
	- Increases down the groups as there are more electrons shells.
	- As atomic radius increases, the strength of the intermolecular forces of attraction between molecules increases.
	- More energy is required to overcome the strong intermolecular forces of attraction.
- Reactivity
	- Decreases down the group as the atomic radius increases
	- Electronegativity of group 7 decreases down the group
		â†ª measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons to itself (how easy it is to form covalent bonds)
- **Displacement Reactions**
	- More reactive halogen displace less reactive halogen from its compound
	- E.g. Chlorine Gas bubbled into aq potassium iodide, potassium choride is formed and iodine is released
	- $Cl_{2} (g) + 2KI (aq) \rightarrow 2KCl(aq) + I_2(aq)$

# Group 0 Elements
- Noble Gases
- Non-metal, Monoatomic
- Properties:
	- Colourless
	- Low melting and boiling points
	- Inert / Unreactive
	- Full valence shell
- Uses of noble gases
	- Helium - Filling weather balloons and airships
	- Neon - Used in advertising lights
	- Argon - Used to fill lights bulbs as it provides an inert atmosphere
	- Krypton - Used in car headlamps and lasers for medical purposes
	- Xenon - Used in lights for operating rooms and lighthouse lamps

# Transition Metals
- Block of elements in the middl of the Periodic Table without any group numbers
- Properties:
	- High melting and boiling points
	- Hard (unlike group 1 metals)
	- High density
	- Good conductor of heat and electricity
	- Ductile and Malleable
	- Variable valncy
	- Good Catalysts
- Electrical and Thermal Conductivity:
	- Good conductors of electricity and hear
	- Arranged in a giant metallic lattice with strong electrostatic forces of attraction between its "sea" of delocalised electrons and cations.
	- "Sea" of delocalised electrons act as mobile charge carries that conduct electricity and head
- Malleable and Ductile
	- When force applied, metal atoms are able to slide over each other 
	- Without breaking the metallic bond between the "sea" of delocalised electrons and cations in a giant metallic lattice
- Variable Valency
	- Variable valency and oxidation states as they can form compounds containing ions with vary charges
	- ðŸŒŸ Zinc and silver will always have a charge of +2 and +1 respectively
- Catalysts
	- Some transition metals and their compounds are good catalysts
	- Easily give and receive electrons from other molecules
	- Increase the rate of reaction by providing an alternative pathway of lower activation energy 
	- Remains chemically unchaged a the end of the reaction.
